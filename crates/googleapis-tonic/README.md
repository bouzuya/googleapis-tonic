One of the main benefits of `googleapis-tonic` is that it can be used directly without the need for `tonic-build` or `protoc` to convert `.proto` files to `.rs` files.

`googleapis-tonic` declares many features to let users include only the parts they need.

Due to the extensive range of Google APIs, this crate exceeds the default feature limit set by crates.io. I am currently in contact with the crates.io team to address this limitation.

## Usage

```toml
[dependencies]
googleapis-tonic = { version = "0.2.0", features = ["google-firestore-v1"] }

# By default, the following features are enabled:
# - `hash-map`: Use `HashMap` for map type.
# - `vec-u8`: Use `Vec<u8>` for bytes type.
#
# You can use the following alternative options:
# - `btree-map`: Use `BTreeMap` for map type.
# - `bytes`: Use `bytes::Bytes` for bytes type.
googleapis-tonic = { version = "0.2.0", default-features = false, features = ["btree-map", "bytes", "google-firestore-v1"] }

# The complete list of features is defined in `crates/googleapis-tonic/Cargo.toml`.
```
